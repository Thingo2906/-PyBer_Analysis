# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
- The purpose of the new analysis is well defined: This project involved doing exploratory analysis of ride-sharing data for PyBer in order to create data visualizations based on the relationship between city types and fare charges in order to determine which neighborhoods require funding to increase local access to ride-sharing services.
## Results:
- The data confirms logical inferences of ride-sharing trends, with ride-sharing services becoming less available the further you travel from city centers. The data shows that rural cities had the fewest rides, with only 125, compared to Suburban with 625 and Urban with 1625. The data also shows that ride-sharing charges grow as the distance from the city center increases, which has an influence on the number of Total Riders per city type and accessibility, as just 78 persons utilized ride-sharing services in Rural regions compared to 2405 in Urban areas. The analysis' findings may be seen in the table below:

- The graph below illustrates the discrepancy of ride-sharing services between the three city types, and it clearly displays what are most likely accessibility-influenced patterns:

## Summary:
It would be required to create a ride-sharing infrastructure that could smoothly connect the three areas in order to make ride-sharing more accessible across city types. It is also critical that the service be affordable to all passengers traveling to and from any place. These services must be affordable as well as convenient in terms of commuting time, since high charges or long journey times are likely to deter passengers from utilizing these services as their primary mode of transportation.
